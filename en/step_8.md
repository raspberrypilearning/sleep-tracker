## Upgrade your project

Great work! You have created your micro:bit sleep tracker. Here are some ideas to upgrade your project and create a more advanced sleep tracker:

+ Use a the microphone to detect snoring (v2). If you have a v1 then you could detect the light level
+ Change the sleepy (Zs) animation
+ Plot the number of movements on the LEDs instead of showing the number value
+ Use Logic to display an overall sleep rating rather than a number of events
+ Log sleep events (v2)
+ Power save - turn the LED brightness down on start **and** remove the heart icon that is currently shown after each movement.

</div>

Click on the embedded project.

+ Compare the brightness level on start with the base project
+ Drag the red sound level up to 165 (or more).
+ Press the A or B buttons to see the number of movements and 'snores' detected **and** an overall sleep rating!:
