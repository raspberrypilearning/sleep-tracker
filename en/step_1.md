## You will make

Have you ever wondered how many times you turn over while you sleep?

In this project, you are going to make a sleep tracker that will display how rested you are. 
You can run the program on your micro:bit when it is placed under your pillow, so it can track your sleep movements.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">

Keeping <span style="color: #0faeb0">track</span> of how well you sleep can be really helpful. When you pay attention to things like if you move a lot during the night, you can learn how to sleep even better. Sleeping better makes our brains work better, helps us feel happier, and keeps our bodies healthier.

</p>

You will:
+ Use your micro:bit to monitor your sleep movements
+ Use variables to track your sleep movements
+ Display the number of movements on the micro:bit's LEDs
+ Use buttons and logic to reset the tracker and control the brightness of the LED display
+ Use a loop to create an animation
+ Organise your code using a function
