## Upgrade your project

Great work! You have created your micro:bit sleep tracker. Here are some ideas to upgrade your project and create a more advanced sleep tracker:

+ Use a the microphone to detect snoring (V2). If you have a V1, then you could detect the light level.
+ Change the sleepy (zZs) animation.
+ Plot the number of movements on the LEDs instead of showing the number value.
+ Use Logic to display an overall sleep rating rather than a number of events.
+ Log sleep events (V2).
+ Power save - turn the LED brightness down on start **and** remove the heart icon that is currently shown after each movement.

Click on the embedded project.

+ Compare the brightness level on start with the base project
+ Drag the red sound level up to 165 (or more)
+ Press the A or B buttons to see the number of movements and 'snores' detected **and** an overall sleep rating!
